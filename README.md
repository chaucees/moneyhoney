# MoneyHoney
## About
MoneyHoney is a personal budgeting app where you can input your monthy income sources and expenses and get a break-down of how much spending money you have on a day-to-day basis.
## Technology Stack
MoneyHoney is a MERN stack app using MySQL, Express, React, and Node. Here are the specific libraries and frameworks we've used:
### Front End
* AOS (Animate on Scroll)
* Auth0
* Axios
* React
* React Materialize
* React Router
### Back End
* Express
* MySQL
* Node
* Sequelize
## Future Development
MoneyHoney is still a work in progress. Currently, functionality is limited to creating and deleting Budgets, but connections have not been made between the front end and the database regarding content on those budgets. Additionally, we are still developing logic for the calculation of spending money and the displaying thereof with a chart.

In the future, we would like to allow users to share their budgets and collaborate. Additionally, we would like to integrate with Plaid in order to allow users to connect with their banks for more up-to-date financial information.
